    # --- attribute enchant details ---
    # Deviation : See wikipedia diagram. With a value=0.6 and a deviation=0.1 you'll roughly get values between 0.3 and 0.9 with most values being centered around 0.6 (68% of the values between 0.5 & 0.7) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#/media/File:Standard_deviation_diagram.svg
    # Cumulation : variables: CURRENT=current bonus of the attribute, BONUS=new bonus chosen from value w/ deviation
    # Reroll:   NO_LIMIT = rerolled each time the consumable is put in the anvil)
    #           ITEM_CHANGED = rerolled each time the item changes (enchant, name, attributes))
    #           ATTCHANT_COUNT_ITEM = rerolled each time the item is attribute enchanted

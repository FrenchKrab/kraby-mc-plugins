# MCarcinizer
Plugin with multiple subplugins aimed at improving the/providing a different game experience. Each subplugin can be disabled separately.

## DeathKeeper
On player death, a monster that holds the player's objects spawns.
Default config file: [mcarcinizer/src/main/resources/deathkeeper.yml](mcarcinizer/src/main/resources/deathkeeper.yml)

# HealthHardcorizer
Actually makes the game easier : the food bar is now used as a health bar. The food bar will automatically replenish the health bar.
Will be ported to MCarcinizer soon.
